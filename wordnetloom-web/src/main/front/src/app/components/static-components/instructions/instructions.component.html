                <h5 class="list-item-title">A few words on the structure of the dictionary</h5>
                <p>The “Dictionary of Polish Borrowings in Yiddish” is designed around the concept of word families,
                  i.e. groups of related (cognate) words. For example,
                  in English to stand and stance are parts of a word family, which is evident from the fact that they
                  share a common stem: {{ '{' }}stan{{ '}' }}. Similarly in Yiddish, the words onbregik ‘boundless’
                  and arumbregeven ‘to hem’ belong to one family, where the common stem is {{ '{' }}breg{{ '}' }}.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our dictionary, every word family is centered around one word called the derivational base.
                  Other words in the family are its derivatives. These may also have further words derived from them.
                  Additionally, words that do not formally have the same stem as the rest but are etymologically
                  related are also included in the family. This way, every time you search for a given word, you
                  automatically gain access to all related units.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li id="home-page">
                <h5 class="list-item-title">Home page</h5>
                <p>
                  From here you can perform basic searches. Simply type the chosen word in Yiddish script or the YIVO transliteration and you will be taken to the dictionary view. Leaving the field empty and pressing search will display all entries in the dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You will probably notice that an onscreen keyboard with Yiddish characters appears as soon as you click on the search field.  It is not necessary to use it, you can go on typing regardless. However, if you find the onscreen keyboard distracting, you can click on the keyboard icon left from the search field to turn it off. Clicking again will turn it back on.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you wish to refine your search, you can use advanced search criteria. Click on the sprockets icon left of the search field to display advanced settings. The various options found in this menu will enable you to search the dictionary based on all types of information included in the entries. Since it is more prudent to first explain what these information types mean, the advanced search options will be described further down in this document.
                </p>

              <li id="dictionary-view">
                <h5 class="list-item-title">The dictionary view</h5>
                <p>The dictionary view is divided into four main spaces: 1) the search bar (top), 2) the wordlist (left), 3) the relations graph (middle), 4) the info window (right).</p>

              <ol>
                  <li id="search-bar">
                    <h5 class="list-item-title">The search bar</h5>
                    <p>Works the same as on the Home Page.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li id="wordlist">
                    <h5 class="list-item-title">The wordlist</h5>
                    <p>
                      The <i>wordlist</i> shows your search results.
                      Each entry on the list represents a borrowing from Polish,
                      which may be different from the forms generally recognized in Standard Yiddish.
                      This fact will always be noted in the info window on the right (under <i>Comments</i>).
                      Other forms of the same word, its <i>variants</i>,
                      are listed below the entry and will always include the Standard Yiddish forms.
                      If the word you have entered in the search field is a <i>variant</i>,
                      the wordlist will always display the base entry, to which that variant belongs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Above the list itself you will find the transliteration tab.
                      Here you can select the writing system in which the search results will be displayed.
                      You can choose between the standardized Yiddish alphabet, the YIVO transliteration and the
                      philological transliteration, used in some scientific works. Note that the writing system of the
                      <i>wordlist</i> defaults to what you have used in your search query.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Clicking on an entry will select it for display in the <i>relations&nbsp;graph</i> and the <i>info&nbsp;window</i>.
                      If you click on a variant, the <i>graph</i> will display the main entry,
                      but information on the variant will be shown in the <i>info window</i>.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li id="relations-graph">
                    <h5 class="list-item-title">The relations graph</h5>
                    <p>On the top of the graph window you will see basic grammatical information on the chosen word, eg. part of speech, grammatical gender, plural forms if applicable.</p>
                    <p>You can click on any word visible on the graph to select it. This will display the basic information about it in the area above and details to the right, in the <i>info window</i>.</p>
                    <p>The <i>relations graph</i> itself is used to display and navigate the word families included in the dictionary, as well as their interlingual relations. Units in the dictionary are displayed as text bubbles. The different relations between them are depicted as arrows in different colors. Buttons on the left, right, and bottom of the bubbles are used to expand and hide the relations. If a button is absent on one or more sides of the bubble, this means that the graph cannot be expanded further in these directions from the given bubble.</p>
                    <p>You can move the graph around on the screen by clicking on empty space and holding the mouse button. You can also do this using the mini-map in the upper left corner. Each bubble can also be moved individually by clicking and dragging. If you find the graph window too small, you can close the <i>wordlist</i> and <i>info window</i> by clicking on their outer edge.</p>
                    <p>Four types of relations are depicted in our dictionary: <i>polysemy</i>, <i>derivation</i>, <i>common etymological root</i> and <i>interlingual equivalence</i>. Each type of relation is marked visually by 1) the color of the arrow, 2) the direction of expansion and 3) the abbreviation above the arrow, which may also include additional information.</p>

                    <h6>Polysemy:</h6>
                    <p>
                      color: <span class="color-red">red</span>, direction: down, abbreviation: ps
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In our dictionary, each lexical word is divided into units denoting individual meanings.
                      The number next to the word in every bubble marks a different meaning. Hence <i>polysemy</i> is
                      not so much a relation between words as a depiction of a single word’s internal semantic structure.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Derivation:</h6>
                    <p>color: <span class="color-green">green</span>, direction: left, abbreviation: der</p>
                    <p>In the dictionary, the derivation relation connects a base word with its derivatives. Words connected by the <i>derivation</i> relation make up word families in the traditional sense.</p>
                    <p>Abbreviation extensions note the given derivative’s part of speech:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>der>n</b>: noun</li>
                      <li><b>der>v</b>: verb</li>
                      <li><b>der>adj</b>: adjective</li>
                      <li><b>der>adv</b>: adverb</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h6>Common etymological root:</h6>
                    <p>color: <span class="color-black">black</span>, direction: left, abbreviation: cer</p>
                    <p>Some words, though not derived from one another, may still be connected by common ancestry.
                      This is shown by the <i>common etymological root</i> relation.
                      Examples of such words include Yiddish <i>pashe</i> ‘pasture, fodder’ and pastex ‘herder’.
                      They have certain formal similarities and are semantically connected but, unlike derivatives,
                      they do not share a single stem, as <i>pashe</i> and <i>pashen</i> ‘to pasture, to feed (animals)’ for example.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      All words of common etymological ancestry form what we have termed an <i>extended word family</i>.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Interlingual equivalence:</h6>
                    <p>color: <span class="color-blue">blue</span>, direction: right, abbreviation: eq</p>
                    <p>This relation connects a given word with its semantic equivalents in other languages (also referred to as <i>interlingual synonyms</i>).
                      Abbreviation extensions note the equivalent’s language:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Eq_Pol:</b> Polish</li>
                      <li><b>Eq_Ger:</b> German</li>
                      <li><b>Eq_Eng:</b> English</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>

                  <li id="info-window">
                    <h5 class="list-item-title">The info window</h5>
                    <p>
                      The <i>info window</i> displays detailed information on the word selected from the
                      graph or one of its variants. The latter can be selected either from the <i>wordlist</i>
                      or by clicking on the respective tab on the top of the <i>info window</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Below you will find explanation of the various elements of the window. Please note that the detailed information presented here is meant primarily for the purposes of linguistic research. Hence not all the terms used will be explained in this document. If necessary, please refer to linguistic or encyclopedic sources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Spelling types:</b> each word is shown in Yiddish script, the YIVO transliteration, and the philological transliteration.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Part of speech:</b> each unit is characterized as a specific part of speech. The possibilities are: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, adjective/adverb, conjunction, interjection, particle, pronoun, preposition. If the selected entry is a constituent consisting of more than one word it is described as <i>phrase</i> instead.</p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Grammatical qualifiers:</b> these describe the essential grammatical categories of words. They apply to nouns and verbs only and are different for both parts of speech.
                      <br>
                      For nouns: m. = masculine gender, f. = feminine gender, n. = neutral gender, pl. = plurale tantum.
                      <br>
                      For verbs: tr. = transitive, intr. = intransitive, ref. = reflexive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Inflection:</b> this field includes the plural and diminutive forms of nouns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Meaning:</b> the meaning of the chosen word in English; descriptive when necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>Semantic field:</b> the subject or segment of reality the given word belongs to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Because the possible number of <i>semantic fields</i> is virtually infinite, we have adopted a semi-intuitive system of keywords to provide a general idea of the word’s place in the speaker’s linguistic worldview.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For example the <i>semantic field</i> to which Yiddish <i>kurtke</i> ‘jacket’ belongs is simply characterized with the keyword <i>Clothing</i>. On the other hand, describing the <i>semantic field</i> for <i>arumbregeven</i> ‘to hem a piece of clothing or cloth’ requires a combination of keywords: <i>Craft</i>, <i>production</i>, <i>construction</i> and <i>Clothing</i>, as the word denotes an activity related to clothing production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sometimes modifiers may be added to keywords for further nuancing, eg. <i>tshaste</i> ‘cake’ may be characterized as <i>Nutrition (Human)</i>, while <i>Pashe ‘fodder’</i> - as <i>Nutrition (Animal)</i>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Lexical characteristic</b> his field includes additional characteristics, related to the way the word is constructed. The possibilities are:
                    </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>derivational hybrid: a word made up of clearly demarcated elements from different languages. For example farplonten ‘ensnare, entangle’ consists of the Germanic prefix {{'{'}}far{{'}'}}, the Slavic stem {{'{'}}}plont{{'}'}}} and the Germanic inflectional ending {{'{'}}}en{{'}'}}}.</li>
                        <li>hybrid: a word made up of elements from different languages which are not clearly demarcated and separable. Example: <i>plaplen</i> < German <i>plappern</i> and Polish <i>paplać</i> which seem to have fused into a composite stem {{'{'}}plapl{{'}'}}.</li>
                        <li>phrase: this is to indicate that the entry is a constituent consisting of more than one word.</li>
                      </ul>

                    <p>
                      <b>Rootedness:</b> for the purpose of our research project we have proposed a new typological criterion for classifying lexical units in loanword research which we have termed rootedness. It may be defined as the degree of interconnectedness of a given word within the linguistic system. If a given concept has developed many metaphorical uses for the word that describes it and a large derivative network, we may claim that it is firmly rooted in the lexical system. Based on this criterion, we can classify each word as:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>occasional: words used only for the sake of the text or conversation they appeared in, with little, if any, connection to other elements of the lexicon.</li>
                      <li>borrowing: words that may be firmly rooted based on prolonged and frequent use in Yiddish.</li>
                      <li>relic: words that are firmly rooted because they were carried over from the pre-Yiddish, Slavic speech of Eastern European Jews and remained in frequent use.</li>
                      <li>relic candidate: suspected relics the status of which has not yet been conclusively determined.</li>
                      <li>uncertain: words the rootedness of which cannot be established.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      <b>Etymology:</b> the source-language cognate, the given word’s postulated etymological ancestor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Age:</b> he word’s age based on attestation date and described broadly as 1) <i>up to 1800</i>, <i>2) 1800-1939</i>, <i>3) 1939-1955</i>, <i>4) unknown</i>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Sources:</b> the list of sources in which the word or some aspect of it (such as the plural form or a specific meaning) was attested.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Etymological root:</b> contrary to <i>etymology</i>, this field does not contain the direct etymological ancestor of the given unit but rather an abstracted primordial stem common to all the words in the <i>extended family</i>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Morphology:</b> this field shows the word separated into morphemes, eg. <i>iberkhitreven</i> ‘to outwit’ is segmented into <i>iber|khitr|eve|n</i>. Hovering the cursor over each morpheme will display additional information.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the above-mentioned categories may be used to quickly find all the entries that share them. Simply click on an element in each category to display such entries in the wordlist. The “navigable” categories are: <i>semantic field, style, lexical characteristic, rootedness, age, etymological root</i>, and <i>morphology</i>. For example, if you click on the suffix -EVE- in <i>iber|khitr|eve|n</i>, you will see all the words that have it.</p>

To do this, simply tick the appropriate box. This is necessary for searches based on categories such as <i>etymology</i>, which do not have a set list of values.
                </p>
                <p><b>Narrow down:</b> this option allows you to filter the database based on those categories from the <i>info window</i> that have a fixed list of values, such as <i>part of speech</i> or <i>semantic field</i>. Clicking on <i>narrow down</i> will open a list of such categories. You can then open drop-down menus by clicking on each category and choose the desired value. You can filter the database based on several categories at once.</p>
                <p>
                  It is possible to use both types of advanced search options at once. For example, you can choose to search for a specific <i>etymological root</i> but limit the results to nouns of feminine gender by specifying these values as filters.
